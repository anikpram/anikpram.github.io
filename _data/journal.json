      "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this work is to introduce a single model-based deep network that
      can provide highquality reconstructions from undersampled parallel MRI data acquired with multiple sequences,
      acquisition settings and field strengths. <br><br>
      Methods: A single unrolled architecture, which offers good reconstructions for multiple acquisition settings,
      is introduced. The proposed scheme adapts the model to each setting by scaling the CNN features and the
      regularization parameter with appropriate weights. The scaling weights and regularization parameter are
      derived using a multi-layer perceptron model from conditional vectors, which represents the specific acquisition setting. The perceptron parameters and the CNN weights are jointly trained using data from multiple
      acquisition settings, including differences in field strengths, acceleration, and contrasts. The conditional
      network is validated using datasets acquired with different acquisition settings. <br><br>
      Results: The comparison of the adaptive framework, which trains a single model using the data from all
      the settings, shows that it can offer consistently improved performance for each acquisition condition. The
      comparison of the proposed scheme with networks that are trained independently for each acquisition setting
      shows that it requires less training data per acquisition setting to offer good performance. <br><br>
      Conclusion: The Ada-MoDL framework enables the use of a single model-based unrolled network for
      multiple acquisition settings. In addition to eliminating the need to train and store multiple networks for
      different acquisition settings, this approach reduces the training data needed for each acquisition setting.",

      "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging",
      "abstract": "Computational imaging has been revolutionized by compressed sensing algorithms,
      which offer guaranteed uniqueness, convergence, and stability properties.
      Model-based deep learning methods that combine imaging physics with learned
      regularization priors have emerged as more powerful alternatives for image recovery.
      The main focus of this paper is to introduce a memory efficient model-based algorithm
      with similar theoretical guarantees as CS methods. The proposed iterative algorithm alternates
      between a gradient descent involving the score function and a conjugate gradient algorithm
      to encourage data consistency. The score function is modeled as a monotone convolutional neural network.
      Our analysis shows that the monotone constraint is necessary and sufficient to enforce the
      uniqueness of the fixed point in arbitrary inverse problems. In addition,
      it also guarantees the convergence to a fixed point, which is robust to input perturbations.
      We introduce two implementations of the proposed MOL framework, which differ in the way the
      monotone property is imposed. The first approach enforces a strict monotone constraint,
      while the second one relies on an approximation. The guarantees are not valid for the
      second approach in the strict sense. However, our empirical studies show that the
      convergence and robustness of both approaches are comparable, while the less
      constrained approximate implementation offers better performance.
      The proposed deep equilibrium formulation is significantly more memory efficient
      than unrolled methods, which allows us to apply it to 3D or 2D+time problems that
      current unrolled algorithms cannot handle.",

      "abstract": "Structured low-rank (SLR) algorithms, which exploit annihilation relations between the Fourier
      samples of a signal resulting from different properties, is a powerful image reconstruction
      framework in several applications. This scheme relies on low-rank matrix completion to estimate
      the annihilation relations from the measurements. The main challenge with this strategy is the high
      computational complexity of matrix completion. We introduce a deep learning (DL) approach to
      significantly reduce the computational complexity. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural
      network (CNN)-based filterbank that is trained to estimate the annihilation relations from
      imperfect (under-sampled and noisy) k-space measurements of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The
      main reason for the computational efficiency is the pre-learning of the parameters of the non-linear
      CNN from exemplar data, compared to SLR schemes that learn the linear filterbank parameters from
      the dataset itself. Experimental comparisons show that the proposed scheme can enable
      calibration-less parallel MRI; it can offer performance similar to SLR schemes while reducing the
      runtime by around three orders of magnitude. Unlike pre-calibrated and self-calibrated approaches,
      the proposed uncalibrated approach is insensitive to motion errors and affords higher acceleration.
      The proposed scheme also incorporates image domain priors that are complementary, thus
      significantly improving the performance over that of SLR schemes.",

      "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",
      "abstract": "Image reconstruction using deep learning algorithms offers improved reconstruction quality and lower
       reconstruction time than classical compressed sensing and model-based algorithms. Unfortunately, clean and fully
       sampled ground-truth data to train the deep networks is often unavailable in several applications, restricting
       the applicability of the above methods. We introduce a novel metric termed the ENsemble Steinâ€™s Unbiased
       Risk Estimate (ENSURE) framework, which can be used to train deep image reconstruction algorithms without
       fully sampled and noisefree images. The proposed framework is the generalization of the classical SURE and GSURE
       formulation to the setting here the images are sampled by different measurement operators, chosen randomly
       from a set. We evaluate the expectation of the GSURE loss functions over the sampling patterns to obtain the
       ENSURE loss function. We show that this loss is an unbiased estimate for the true mean-square error,
       which offers a better alternative to GSURE, which only offers an unbiased estimate for the projected error.
       Our experiments show that the networks trained with this loss function can offer reconstructions comparable
       to the supervised setting. While we demonstrate this framework in the context of MR image recovery,
       the ENSURE framework is generally applicable to arbitrary inverse problems." ,
