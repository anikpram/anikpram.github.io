      "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this work is to introduce a single model-based deep network that
      can provide highquality reconstructions from undersampled parallel MRI data acquired with multiple sequences,
      acquisition settings and field strengths. <br><br>

      Methods: A single unrolled architecture, which offers good reconstructions for multiple acquisition settings,
      is introduced. The proposed scheme adapts the model to each setting by scaling the CNN features and the
      regularization parameter with appropriate weights. The scaling weights and regularization parameter are
      derived using a multi-layer perceptron model from conditional vectors, which represents the specific acquisition setting. The perceptron parameters and the CNN weights are jointly trained using data from multiple
      acquisition settings, including differences in field strengths, acceleration, and contrasts. The conditional
      network is validated using datasets acquired with different acquisition settings. <br><br>

      Results: The comparison of the adaptive framework, which trains a single model using the data from all
      the settings, shows that it can offer consistently improved performance for each acquisition condition. The
      comparison of the proposed scheme with networks that are trained independently for each acquisition setting
      shows that it requires less training data per acquisition setting to offer good performance. <br><br>

      Conclusion: The Ada-MoDL framework enables the use of a single model-based unrolled network for
      multiple acquisition settings. In addition to eliminating the need to train and store multiple networks for
      different acquisition settings, this approach reduces the training data needed for each acquisition setting.",

      inverse problems in imaging. The proposed algorithm relies on
      forward-backward splitting, where each iteration consists of a gradient descent
      involving the score function and a conjugate gradient algorithm to encourage data
      consistency. The score function is modeled as a monotone convolutional neural
      network. The use of a monotone operator offers several benefits, including
      guaranteed convergence, uniqueness of fixed point, and robustness to input
      perturbations, similar to the use of convex priors in compressive sensing. In
      addition, the proposed formulation is significantly more memory-efficient than
      unrolled methods, which allows us to apply it to 3D problems that current unrolled
      algorithms cannot handle. Experiments show that the proposed scheme can offer
      improved performance in 3D settings while being stable in the presence of input

      "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",
      "abstract": "Structured low-rank (SLR) algorithms, which exploit annihilation relations between the Fourier
      samples of a signal resulting from different properties, is a powerful image reconstruction
      framework in several applications. This scheme relies on low-rank matrix completion to estimate
      the annihilation relations from the measurements. The main challenge with this strategy is the high
      computational complexity of matrix completion. We introduce a deep learning (DL) approach to
      significantly reduce the computational complexity. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural
      network (CNN)-based filterbank that is trained to estimate the annihilation relations from
      imperfect (under-sampled and noisy) k-space measurements of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The
      main reason for the computational efficiency is the pre-learning of the parameters of the non-linear
      CNN from exemplar data, compared to SLR schemes that learn the linear filterbank parameters from
      the dataset itself. Experimental comparisons show that the proposed scheme can enable
      calibration-less parallel MRI; it can offer performance similar to SLR schemes while reducing the
      runtime by around three orders of magnitude. Unlike pre-calibrated and self-calibrated approaches,
      the proposed uncalibrated approach is insensitive to motion errors and affords higher acceleration.
      The proposed scheme also incorporates image domain priors that are complementary, thus
      significantly improving the performance over that of SLR schemes.",

      "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",
      "abstract": "Image reconstruction using deep learning algorithms offers improved reconstruction quality and lower
      reconstruction time than classical compressed sensing and model-based algorithms. Unfortunately, clean and
      fully sampled ground-truth data to train the deep networks is often not available in several applications,
      restricting the applicability of the above methods. This work introduces the ENsemble Stein's Unbiased Risk
      Estimate (ENSURE) framework as a general approach to train deep image reconstruction algorithms without fully
      sampled and noise-free images. The proposed framework is the generalization of the classical SURE and GSURE
      formulation to the setting where the images are sampled by different measurement operators, chosen randomly
      from a set. We show that the ENSURE loss function, which only uses the measurement data, is an unbiased
      estimate for the true mean-square error. Our experiments show that the networks trained with this loss
      function can offer reconstructions comparable to the supervised setting. While we demonstrate this framework
      in the context of MR image recovery, the ENSURE framework is generally applicable to arbitrary inverse problems." ,
