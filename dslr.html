<span style="font-weight: 100">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides an excellent
soft tissue contrast at the expense of long acquisition times.
MRI scan times are directly proportional to image resolu-
tion, thus, warranting accelerated acquisition schemes. Paral-
lel MRI (PMRI) was introduced for faster acquisition. It uses
an array of coils, spatially sensitive to different regions of
the organ of interest1, enabling undersampled acquisitions.
PMRI reconstruction approaches can be classified into pre-
calibrated, auto-calibrated and calibration-less, depending
on the estimation of coil sensitivities. While, pre-calibrated
SENSE2 obtains sensitivity information from additional cal-
ibration scans, auto-calibrated GRAPPA3 estimates it from
a fully sampled region in center of k-space.
